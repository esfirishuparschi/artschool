            <h2> About Us </h2>
     <p> 
        At an individual master class in pottery, you immerse yourself in the world of pottery. A professional potter will tell you about the clay, its properties, and under his guidance, you will independently prepare the clay for work. Such master classes are most often attended with a close friend or girlfriend, the whole family. They also give a certificate for the holiday to those who wish to learn pottery.
</p>
<p>
       Individual master classes are held in a relaxed atmosphere, which allows you and your friends to fully experience the finest moments of working with clay and learn what pottery is.
       In pottery, you will be assisted by an experienced craftsman who will not only give individual advice on clay modeling, but will also do everything to make your ceramic works become a home decoration.
